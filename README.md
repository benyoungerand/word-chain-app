An application used to process the dictionary given as part of the word-chain challange into a json file with relationships (JSON Formatter project).

This JSON was then used to populate a neo4j database - which was then called to find the shortest path.

Please ask Ben for variables needed in Commands.cs

Below is a visualisation of how data is stored in the database, I just thought it looked pretty cool
